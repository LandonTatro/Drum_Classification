# Drum_Classification - AI Academy Capstone

# Purpose
Speech recognition other sound recognition has been a major point of interest in the data science field for many years now, and has naturally found its way into the arts. This project has a long term goal of creating a model that will predict common drum sounds in real time. Theoretically, this can be deployed in a phone app where a plain text notation of all of the notes played will be transcribed to the device.

An example of a theoretical output could be:

In its current state, the model is capable of predicting among seven categores with high accuracy.

The seven categories are:

  - Snare
  - Rack Tom
  - Floor Tom
  - Bass
  - Hi-hat
  - Crash
  - Ride
